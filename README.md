# bash-scripting

Often terminal commands are called from Python with `os.system` or `subroutine` libraries. This complements Python's abilities, and there is some functionality to be achieved by doing it the other way around - calling Python programs from the terminal. This is going beyond entering just one or two commands like `ls` or `grep` to having a short script.
